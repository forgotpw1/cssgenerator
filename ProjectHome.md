CSSGenerator is a Python script that given an URL and a filename, it extracts color information (from CSS files and style elements) and it stores them in the filename.

It depends on [CSSUtils](http://cthedot.de/cssutils/) (for css files capture and parsing) and [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) (for html parsing) libraries
